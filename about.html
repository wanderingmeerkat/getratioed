        <h1>Welcome to the Pi Network</h1>
        <p>If you've made it here, chances are you've been invited to join the Pi network. What is it?</p>
        <p>Simply put, it's a network of people who care deeply about fostering quality social connection. 
        We believe that social connection is fundamental to the human experience, and that it is currently lacking in our time. 
        Members of the Pi Network are actively working on ways to help people socialize again. We host events, we reach out to old friends, we introduce our current friends to new ones. <b>We live like humans.</b></p>
        
        <h2>Protocols</h2>
        <p>There are a few rules and protocols for everyone on the network. Consider them when deciding if you should join:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick a membership number when joining. You simply chose a digit of Pi (0-9). The author writing this is a 2.</li>
            <li>To get an urgent message out to the entire network, contact members whose numbers are the two digits surrounding your digit in Pi (for me, that'd be 9 and 6). When doing so, ensure both members are aware that the message is urgent.</li>
            <li>Members may pass on your contact information to someone else within the network. By joining you consent to being contacted by other members, some of whom you may not originally know.</li> 
            <li>Members may write other members a <i>letter of introduction</i>, describing the member and advocating for them. If you receive a letter of introduction for someone and are told they are in your vicinity, do your best to be accomdating. This can include meeting up with them, introducing them to other people in the area, and even providing a safe place to rest for the night. That last point is not required, but highly encouraged. Note: It does not need to be a physical letter, digital letters can suffice.</li>
            <li>Members in the vicinity of each other may collectively form a local Pi club. Clubs can be formed anywhere, and must uphold Pi principles (see below). The club structure effectively makes the Pi network a <b>network of networks</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Members of the network are expected to uphold the following principles. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Respect</b>: members must always show respect for themselves, other members, and for others.</li>
            <li><b>Love</b>: members recognize love as the ultimate element of the human experience. Members foster environments and forge relationships embodied by love.</li>
            <li><b>Duty</b>: members feel a sense of duty to better themselves, their fellow members, and the world around them.</li>
            <li><b>Truth</b>: members value truth as the basis upon which all action ought to be taken. The determination of truth is an act of the utmost importance, with the shared establishment of truth being a desired outcome.</li>
        </ul>
